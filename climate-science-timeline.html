                    <p>Since the beginning of the <span class="bold">Industrial Revolution</span>, the way people live and work has changed dramatically as manufacturing expanded. Over time, more and more fossil fuels were burned, increasing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Before the Industrial Revolution, the level of CO2 in the air was about 280 parts per million (ppm). Today, that level is over 400 ppm.</p>

                    <p>U.S. scientists <span class="bold">Stephen V. Smith and R. W. Buddemeier</span> pointed out that more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean could be a problem for coral reefs. Later experiments confirmed their hypothesis that CO2 makes seawater slightly acidic, making it difficult for corals and other animals to build reefs. Today, the scientist Joanie Kleypas at NCAR is building on their work, researching the effects of the acidic ocean on marine life.</p>

                    <h3>The Effect of Climate Change on Extreme Weather</h3>
                    <p>A new branch of climate science, called attribution research, has formed to study how global climate change affects extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, floods and droughts. Every year since 2011, the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society has published a special report on extreme weather events in the past year and how the risk of severe weather has changed due to climate change.</p>
